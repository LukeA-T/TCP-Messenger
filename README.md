This is a simple host-client messenger application using TCP protocol.

<br>

Instructions: 

1. Download either the 'TCPMessengerClient_v1.4' .JAR file or the 'TCPMessengerServer_v1.4' .JAR file, depending on whether you want to be the host or the client.

2. Run the client application and the server application.

3. Give yourself a name (or leave it as 'Client'/'Server' by default)

4. Determine the IP address of the server host. Use the host's local IP address if the client is in the same network, otherwise use the host's public IP address.

5. Enter the IP address of the host into the Host IP address field, and press the 'Connect' button.

6. If the connection is successful, you will get a 'connection successful' message.

7. Type a message into the input text box, and press the 'Send' button to send a message to the host/client.
