4. Give yourself a name (or leave it as 'Client'/'Server' by default)

5. Enter the IP address of the host into the Host IP address field, and press the 'Connect' button.

6. If the connection is successful, you will get a 'connection successful' message.

7. Type a message into the input text box, and press the 'Send' button to send a message to the host/client.
